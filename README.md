# 🚗 Zombie Car Driving (Unity)

## 🧠 Game Concept

The player drives a car that must dodge randomly placed obstacles and avoid zombies spawning from the left and right of the screen. You are allowed **three hits**—from either zombies or obstacles. Survive the chase and cross the **finish line** to win. If all three lives are lost, it’s **Game Over**.
